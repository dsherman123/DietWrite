# DietWrite
A behavior-focused food tracking system that emphasizes mindful eating, pre-meal planning, and habit interruption by encouraging users to write—literally or digitally—what they’re about to eat or have just eaten. No calorie counting. No shaming. Just awareness + exchange-based planning.
